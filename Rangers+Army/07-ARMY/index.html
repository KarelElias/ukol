        <h4>What is it?</h4>
        <p>The U.S. Army Vision is the Secretary of the Army and Chief of Staff’s guidance for building <br> 
        a lethal army to meet the nation’s needs over the next ten years.</p>
        <h4>What has the Army done / is doing?</h4>
        <P>The future Army Vision outlines five objectives: <br>
            
            -  MAN - Grow the Active Army above 500,000 Soldiers with associated growth in the <br> 
               Army Reserve and National Guard. <br>
            
            -  ORGANIZE - Ensure war-fighting formations have sufficient infantry, armor, engineer, <br> 
               artillery and air defense assets. <br>

            -  TRAIN - Focus on high-intensity conflict, with emphasis on operating in dense urban <br> 
               terrain, electronically degraded environs and under constant surveillance. <br>
            
            -  EQUIP - Reform the current acquisition system and unify the modernization enterprise <br> 
               under a single command. The intent will be to focus on delivering the weapons, combat <br> 
               vehicles, sustainment systems and equipment when Soldiers need it. <br>

            -  LEAD - Develop smart, thoughtful and innovative leaders of character. Leaders who are <br> 
               comfortable with complexity and are capable of operating from the tactical to strategic <br> 
               level. <br> </P>
