                to the unit. They possess a variety of experience <br> 
                in conventional and special operations units and <br>
                have extensive special skills training. Ranger <br> 
                officers are second-time platoon leaders, <br>
                company commanders and battalion <br> 
                commanders. They take valuable lessons learned <br> 
                in combat and tactics, techniques and <br> 
                procedures with them to their next assignments. <br> </h3>
